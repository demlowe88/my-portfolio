      <h1><b>-Just Blaze-</b></h1>
      <h2><u>Hip-Hop's Uncompromising Arteur</u></h2>
    </div>

      <h3><b>In the Beginning...</b></h3>
      <p>If there were ever a bored individual in need of a list of ten undebatable facts, numbers one through eight would be, "Justin Smith (better known as the Megatron Don, Just Blaze) is your favorite producer's favorite producer." The hits are seemingly endess and conincide with the rise of one Hip-Hop's greatest labels and the release of Jay-Z's last truly classic album. After a stint at Rutger's University, the Patterson, New Jersey native thought it wise to pursue his music career and the world has been better for it. Just's break into the into the music industry is actually quite unconventional and leans heavily on his skill creating ringtones for two-way pagers long before anyone had even thought it possible to put an MP3 on a mobile phone. This ringtone tinkering afforded him quite a bit of popularity and by the time 1999 rolled around Just had his first major placement with the eponymous <i>I like it</i> by the Ma$e backed pop-rap group, Harlem World. The song itself wasn't all that great and the group flopped but <i>I like it</i> managed to reach as high as number eight on US Hip-Hop charts.

      <h3><b>It's the R.O.C.</b></h3>
      <p>Summer 2002 ushered in the monster Hip-Hop hit known as <i>Oh Boy</i> by Harlem native, Cam'ron with a feature from fellow Harlemite Juelz Santana. It seemed as though there wasn't a stereo in my Irving, Texas neighborhood that was safe and sheltered from the 800 lb. gorilla. Built on an expertly chopped and syncopated snippet of Rose Royce's <i>I'm Going Down</i>, the track made for a very hot Summer. Let's hop in the Delorean and take a a trip back a little less than a year prior. Jay-Z, considered one of the greatest rappers to ever exchange oxygen with Earth's atmosphere, released what many still consider the greatest album in his lengthy catalogue: <i>The Blueprint</i>. The vast majority of the album's beats were crafted by Just Blaze and a pre-solo career Kanye West. Jay's single <i>Girls, Girls, Girls</i> went on to become a major hit (though some were under the impression West produced the track) and marked the beginning of Just's incredible run with Rocafella Records. Emotional street anthems like Freeway's <i>What We Do</i> and Memphis Bleek's <i>Dear Summer</i> only served to further cement Just as Rocafella's go-to in-house producer.

      <h3><b>No Handclaps This Time</b></h3>
      <p>
        A well underway millenium saw Just calmly and quietly continue his streak of bangers. Producing for everyone from Faith Evans to Lenny Kravitz to Kanye West with his hit <i>Touch the Sky</i>. Pop hits included Joe Budden's perennial pep rally anthem (likely due to no one actually listening to the lyrics) <i>Pump It Up (The Jumpoff)</i> and culminated in Jay-Z's inescapable Summer smash <i>She Me What You Got</i>. What's remarkable is that during all these years different sounds came and went and so-called super-producers weren't so super anymore. Through it all though, Just maintained his sound no matter the genre; you knew it was a Just Blaze track by how it made your speakers knock.

      <h3><b>Chasing the Hi-Hat All Over the Track</b></h3>
      <p>It seems like Just Blaze can do no wrong, having produced more than his fair share of Grammy-bait smash singles and street anthems over the years but somehow it isn't enough. Blaze, slowly but surely, has stretched out to other  genres such as EDM's take on the Trap sound and producing scores for 2010's A-Team reboot and Capcom's Ultra Street Fighter IV. While his productioin output may not be as prolific these days, Just Blaze continues drop quality content as his Soundcloud would show anyone willing to lend an ear. You should check him out.
